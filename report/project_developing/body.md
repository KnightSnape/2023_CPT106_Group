# Develop Processing

## Develop Plan

The development plan is a crucial component for the successful completion of our C++ project. It outlines the project's overall objectives, timeline, and division of work. The following is our group's development plan for developing this project.

1. Define project objectives:

   Prior to commencing the project, we will establish clear objectives and requirements.  First, we had a quick discussion to determine the topic (Group C: parking system). After that, we divided into two groups: development group and documentation group. At the same time, we decided to use WeChat for intra-group communication and Git for code and document progress synchronization. The development and documentation teams choose their own toolchains and internal divisions. Finally, the team leader creates the GitHub repository and sets up the main-dev-feature development stream.

2. Division of Work:

   We will assign specific responsibilities to each team member based on their strengths, skills, and interests. As a team, we will collaboratively determine the tasks and deliverables for each phase of the project. This will promote effective teamwork and ensure that each team member contributes to the project's success.

   a. Development Team:

   Two team members will be responsible for the actual development of the C++ project. The development team members communicated quickly, designed a project solution with high cohesion and low coupling (see below), and quickly implemented it. It is worth mentioning that one of the project team members, whose computers are all based on the GNU Linux operating system, will complete the project using platform - and compiler-independent syntax.

   b. Documentation Team:

   The other two team members will be responsible for preparing the project report and documentation. They will collect and organize relevant information about the project, including the design decisions, implementation details, and test results. They will ensure that the project report is well-structured, concise, and accurately represents the work completed. In addition, because Git is based on version control of changes to text files, it does not work well with MS Word files (such as .docx). The documentation team uses $\LaTeX$ to write documents, a format that uses plain text to record the original content and can easily generate pdf files.

3. Testing and Quality Assurance: 

   > Generated by ChatGPT, to be modified.

   Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, and we will dedicate adequate time and resources to it. We will perform various levels of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, to ensure the reliability and correctness of our project. We will also prioritize quality assurance measures to identify and rectify any issues or bugs.

By following this development plan, we aim to successfully complete the C++ project within the given timeframe while meeting all the project requirements and delivering a high-quality solution.
